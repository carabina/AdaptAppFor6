Adapting Existing Apps for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus

Apple says that existing iOS apps will "just work" on iPhone 6 and 6+ devices. 
This is accomplished by scaling the existing user interfaces to the new device 
dimensions. If you want your apps to take full advantage of the larger screens 
on these new devices you must do a little more work.

During this 1-hour on-line presentation I will introduce you to the changes 
necessary to adapt an existing iOS application to work with the iPhone 6 and 
6+. This goes beyond just building with iOS 8. We will look at replacing 
launch images, enhancements to the XCAsset asset catalog, adding @3x 
resources, what the different size classes really mean, etc. I will take an 
existing application that was built for the iPhone and adapt it to the new 
devices.
